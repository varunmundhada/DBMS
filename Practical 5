-- Find Transporters Who Have a Vehicle Capacity Greater Than the Average
SELECT * 
FROM Transporter 
WHERE Capacity > (SELECT AVG(Capacity) FROM Transporter);

SELECT * 
FROM Transporter 
WHERE Location = (SELECT Location FROM Transporter WHERE Name = 'Rajesh Logistics');

SELECT f.* 
FROM Farmer f
INNER JOIN Transporter t ON f.TransporterID = t.TransporterID
WHERE t.Name = 'Specific Transporter Name';  -- Replace with actual transporter name

-- INNER JOIN between cotton and farmer
SELECT * 
FROM Cotton c
INNER JOIN Farmer f ON c.FarmerID = f.FarmerID;

-- LEFT JOIN between bales and ginning_factory
SELECT * 
FROM Bales b
LEFT JOIN Ginning_Factory g ON b.FactoryID = g.FactoryID;

-- RIGHT JOIN between yarn and ginner
SELECT * 
FROM Yarn y
RIGHT JOIN Ginner g ON y.GinnerID = g.GinnerID;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN between spinner and yarn
SELECT * 
FROM Spinner s
FULL OUTER JOIN Yarn y ON s.SpinnerID = y.SpinnerID;

-- NATURAL JOIN between cotton and farmer (only if both have FarmerID)
SELECT * 
FROM Cotton 
NATURAL JOIN Farmer;
